I bet she’s not gonna stop Mona from filming Cannon 😂😂😂  I’m so sick of jasmine the whore rasheeda did not book this whore good enough That jasmine is miserable nobody wants that nasty lil slut remember she was with Mimi ex Rodney who pimped her for money What happens when you knowingly sleep with MARRIED men, separated or not, cry a river get over it🤷🏽‍♀️ Keep your legs closed to married men in My Nene voice 🥴 She doesn’t owe you anything including raising your bastard ✔️   y’all be so dumb‼️ she’s not saying she needs help she saying if you wanna make comments about what’s he needs and what’s supposed to be ETHER HELP POTTY TRAIN HIM OR STFU MFS BE TO COMFORTABLE COMENTING ON POLS KIDS she ain’t went in her life her dirty ass husband brought her in they shit y’all bitches be dumb talking just taking money like that little boy don’t need a mf father bitches sleep with mf mans everyday this shit ain’t nothing y’all annoying as hell Who caresssss it’s still her husband & jasmine wanted her son to be involved so bad now he’s Rasheed’s step-son & she loves him sooo what else ????!  Idec. Don’t let them film with him then. Easy fix, yall just love drama .ink.drops  correct !!!!! People bashing her but cool with Kirk that’s been cheating every season .  realtalk because her business's ain't making that much money to support they lifestyle She dumb af ur baby can operate a phone n still wears pull ups? Smh rasheeda owes u nothing Did she forget shes the side hoe 😂😂💯💯💯  No i don’t support her messing with a married man she’s just as disgusting as he is for cheating on his wife however that baby don’t have anything to do with nothing he deserves his father just like any other kid 🤷🏽‍♀️he knew what he was doing when he was doing it deal with the consequences He’s sill the boys dad. Regardless. He can step up. He busted raw and made a baby too  👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 It’s Kirk fault at the end of the day 🤷🏾‍♀️ he gotta be there for that child like he there for the rest of his kids . Cuhz that lil boy go grow up and resent him for that . This my thing..she said all that but signed off for him to film with them, so is this her way of still being part of the picture🤔. Why even let him film with people you claim really ain't got nothing to do with him anyway? Sounds like she need to cash that check she getting and shit the fuck up. Apparently they didn't want her for a cast member🤷 She wanted Rasheeda to accept him and all that and now she mad over a damn pull up comment...tf...Rasheeda got like 20 kids of course she'd say something MOTHERLY 😆 this little girl here man The truth is, rasheeda could have said, \"its either me or them\". Kirk would have chosen rasheeda. Most married men choose their wives over the side chicks and side babies.🤷 She need to be thanking rasheeda for accepting her son. Otherwise kirk wouldn't be in his life at all..she'd only get child support🤷 So because hes married he not supposed to take care of his child? Sounds bitter..he knew he was mareied also yet he fucked around on his wife..he had a child in the process ..nobody forcing her to stay with him and even still what type of woman tells a man fuck your child u forgive him accept what comes with it By watching you can tell Rasheeda wasn’t feeling the baby being in her presences she probably wanted to try to except him but once you have it in your face it’s hard to except the reality Its common sense not to get involved with a man or a woman when their in a relationship especially if their married.Everyone knows Raising a child is hard and if teenagers can do a good job so can she. So he look like he babd as fuck..so go pick him up and take care of yr own..then u wont have to complain.. Pick the rite one or pick the kiddies up She wack asf   just saw this for real thou So wait......she want Rasheeda to help her potty train the baby SHE had wit HER husband??🤔..... FOH!!  Lol🤣🤣🤣👍 He was acting like he needed to be picked up or get a damn belt on his ass talking bout No and leave me alone  his married ass shouldn’t have even been in a strip club period, if it ain’t for business then stay yo married ass home with your family.\n",

Explain to a 80 year old woman what the heck are we talking about Coonman? Is this for real or is this for real! August 2019 marks the 400th year the first Slave ship landed in Jamestown Virginia 1619. Why are we giggling about Coonman in the 21st Century. Please tell this is not what I think this means.  unfortunately this is exactly what you think very racist, very sad.  we’re not saying this is okay? Our children are going to be called Coons? My great grandfather was born a Slave in Meridian Mississippi In 1853 at the close of the Civil War and before the signing of The Emancipation Proclamation he had not a name no a Birth date, he was called “Nig” until he named himself. We need to pause and have a serious conversation about understanding our history for future generations. Understanding given permission for the world to see us weak and lack knowledge of our history. Thank you for your response I am deeply disappointed with this reality. May I ask you do you have any suggestions how we tackle this issue. I’m open to suggestions. Take this Sh$t off.

      " - Second one is kinda neat tho I’m building a ladder  I'm calling Bender from Futurama Lmfaooooo Nothing beautiful about a wall in the flipping desert. Diet coke is very Donald!   .buchheit I thought of that but this wall, it's flat out ugly. What a waste of resources, including steel. One day they may use it to keep the people in😁  nahhhh we will be fine. I think the more important purpose of the wall is so we can just know whose in the country because every country has the right to document who enters and it’s a pain when ya can’t What to going on Build it  issa fence 20 ft wall? 21 ft ladder business is gonna be boomin. 👏👏 for the handi... Jus walk between it 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸   lmfaoooo  the raccoon one kills me  second slide Muricaaaaaaaa!!! .buchheit But that is not what is happening. Even if it was about documentation, this caravan of displaced and indigent people would have been met with water, food, shelter and paperwork. Instead, the tyranny and violence of Trump and his SS men has created generations of children who are growing up hating us. For all this nation's horrible acts perpertrated against them, cannot blame the immigrants. Sure, use your money for it then. 👌🏾  yeah the secret police who don’t exist, there’s laws and you have to apply for asylum and if you skip that process you don’t get the best conditions, ask all the Syrians sitting in Germany right now .buchheit That's the point. They have to physically cross the border with out assistance. Once over the border they ask for asylum. This could have been done in a humane and orderly fashion without killing children and ripping them out of their parents arms, that is an act of facism. Then incarcerating the  children, separate from their parents, then losing children, unable to identify their parents in this unorganized shit show Trump has going on. And it would have saved the taxpayers a few millions dollars, from his admitted fiasco sending an unnecessary troops down there. Destroying families and wasting resources is the Trump way.  that’s the Trump way?? This has been going on for years and like it doesn’t make it better but this was going on during the Obama and I believe Bush admins as well You could easily just put something over the spikes after monkey climbing the post you call a wall haha .buchheit That has been misconstrued. Obama put in a law that in reference to arrested at the border with children, that the parents had to be confirmed, to ensure it wasn't a kidnapped child. This going on is all Trump and his SS people called ICE. No human reason for it. Everyone knew about this caravan. Everyone had plenty of time to properly and humanely plan for it. There is no reason for the way it was handled, it was incompetence. .buchheit Wow that line sucked. Supposed to say, 'in reference to arrest at the border with children...   19ft ladders are going out of business Wall< fence 🤔 you should put them as Big Chungus Lhfh the last one would keep me out my guy 🤣 a nice privacy fence would be chill with me  haha\n",

      " - It was very good and emotional but had some disappointing moments in it. Liked Infinity War more Eeeek so many emotions 😭😭 I love you 3000 😭😭😭😭😭😭 Es war echt so, JEDER im Kino hat geweint 😭💔 Heartbroken when Ironman died😭 I loved it and hated it and cried so hard. But I was also so what disappointed with how a few things went. But I think it was a good ending even though it broke my heart to say goodbye to my favorite characters 😭 La película me encanto, hubo muchos momentos emotivos que casi me hacen gritar, aunque de igual forma los momentos triste me hicieron llorar, fue una película muy chida... Oh, the movie was amazing! It was an awesome ending to an epic series. I was sad when I saw someone die, and some of my friends cried throughout the movie. It was really sentimental to see their last goodbye after more than a decade of good movies and intriguing plots. RIP Stan Lee too. I cried a lot when blackwidow dying almost screamed please don't, i like her so much It was a rollercoaster of emotions for me. Going into the cinema, I knew there were gonna be deaths (cuz the actors' contracts were up) so I was bracing myself for it. But wow. I was still reduced to a blubbering mess. The tears just kept coming. Especially during the part where Romanov died. She and Hawkeye were my ship and OTP. So to find out that they really loved each other really made me happy. But it killed me that they never got the happy ending they deserved. The Tony part also killed me. The moment Strange looked at him, that was it for me. My eyes were like faucets. Gahhhh. And while I'm sad that Cap and Bucky didn't have much time to be together in the end, I'm glad that he lived a full and good life with Peggy.  Also, the fact that this whole era is coming to an end is bittersweet. The Marvel universe just wouldn't be the same without the original 6. 😭😭😭 It is a cinematic masterpiece! It was just incredible I saw it last week and again today and I cried so much😂 especially when nat and tony died tears were just streaming down my face💔 but I also laughted a lot and would watch it a million times❤️❤️\n",

      " - He must’ve heard the rumors  Fr 😂😂😂 Does it really matter if we lose He wouldn’t make any other roster in the NBA, why he make the Pistons roster? And plays a lot! #smh Congratulations  Hopefully this game will be 1 of 1000 more for you.  one he only plays like 15 minutes per game and is in his second season, and two theres players worse than him on literally every single nba team  he shouldn’t be playing at all cause he shouldn’t be on the roster! He is not good enough & trust me it’s several of them on the Pistons! WE NEED BETTER PLAYERS! #period  you dont watch the games  You must be confused with Henry Ellenson. Kennard is fine. He needs more minutes imo  Yes. No Blake, along with a bunch of other injuries, we were expected to lose to the Sixers. Kennard just came back from an injury. Good to see him play well. Luke You always had it in you beast mode baby beast mode Detroit Pistons .z nice game  your high the Lakers wanted him during the draft  in a loss congrats Pistons r shit  he ain’t shit! Period, point, blank! We was doing much better when his ass was sidelined! Now we about to be 500 again! Lol 😂😂😂  😂 watched everyone so far! 🤣  He sorry too! 💯  why do you have so much hate for a solid player, he literally just dropped 28 on 5/8 3pt  how you gonna say that after he drops 28. Idc what you think but if you can drop 20+ against a team that’s considered a “contender” you have a good chance that you should be on a NBA roster. Especially if you were a 1st round pick a year ago come on now.  don’t hate em he’s just not good enough to be on the Pistons roster! Let’s see how many he have next game! 😂 .chris4 I can drop 28 too with np...... 🎯 Hopefully, this is just the beginning of coach letting him loose... He needs that green light... Should be starting at SG, with Ish starting at PG  ignorant  bitch you ignorant! Fuck you think you talking to! #mf’a  you’re funny lmao you prob didn’t even make your high school team my guy .chris4 probably didnt graduate either but thats none of my business ig .chris4 I definitely made the team! Can you say you played? No! Cause you didn’t! Born & raised in Detroit! YOU NOT! Lol 😂  keep sucking dick I see you good at it! You couldn’t play so you got your pom poms out! Limos 😂 😂 😂 .chris4 UTICA???? 😂😂😂 As expected did nothing tonight, not sure he fits in this team tbh  disagree he made the right plays tonight. He exactly what this team needs at SG\n",
